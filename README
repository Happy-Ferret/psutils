PostScript Utilities

Web site: https://github.com/rrthomas/psutils
Maintainer: Reuben Thomas <rrt@sc3d.org>

This archive contains some utilities for manipulating PostScript
documents, originally written by Angus Duggan (up to version 1.17).
Page selection and rearrangement are supported, including arrangement
into signatures for booklet printing, and page merging for n-up
printing.

ENVIRONMENT

These utilities should work in any POSIX environment with libpaper.

libpaper: http://packages.qa.debian.org/libp/libpaper.html

PROGRAMS

psbook          rearranges pages into signatures
psselect        selects pages and page ranges
pstops          performs general page rearrangement and selection
psnup           put multiple pages per physical sheet of paper
psresize        alter document paper size
epsffit         fits an EPSF file to a given bounding box

psselect in modeled after Chris Torek's dviselect program, and pstops is
modeled after Tom Rokicki's dvidvi program. psbook is modeled on my own
dvibook program, which borrows heavily from Chris Torek's dviselect.

SCRIPTS

getafm   (sh)   outputs PostScript to retrieve AFM file from printer
showchar (sh)   outputs PostScript to draw a character with metric info
fixdlsrps (perl) filter to fix DviLaser/PS output so that PSUtils works
fixfmps  (perl) filter to fix framemaker documents so that psselect etc. work
fixpsditps (perl) filter to fix Transcript psdit documents to work with PSUtils
fixpspps (perl) filter to fix PSPrint PostScript so that psselect etc. work
fixscribeps (perl) filter to fix Scribe PostScript so that psselect etc. work
fixtpps  (perl) filter to fix Troff Tpscript documents
fixwfwps (perl) filter to fix Word for Windows documents for PSUtils
fixwpps  (perl) filter to fix WordPerfect documents for PSUtils
fixwwps  (perl) filter to fix Windows Write documents for PSUtils
extractres (perl) filter to extract resources from PostScript files
includeres (perl) filter to include resources into PostScript files
psmerge  (perl) hack script to merge multiple PostScript files
showchar (sh)   show character with metrics

INSTALLATION

Edit Makefile to put in required paths for BINDIR, SCRIPTDIR, MANDIR,
INCLUDEDIR, and PERL. Alter values of MANEXT to put the manual pages
in a different section if desired, "make", and "make install".

BUGS

The utilities don't check for PS-Adobe-?.? conformance; they assume documents
conform. Utilities need an extra save/restore around whole document on a
SPARCPrinter with NeWSPrint 1.0, because of bugs in the xnews server.

Bug fixes and suggestions to the bug tracker or maintainer (see the
top of this file).

WINDOWS USERS

*Please* make sure that you have selected "Generate DSC Comments" in your
printer driver setup. These utilities need DSC comments to tell where page
boundaries are.

DVIPS USERS

You must generate with DSC comments for PSUtils to work.
